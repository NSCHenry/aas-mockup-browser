## 1. Executive Summary

### Business Overview

Ambulatory Anesthesia Solutions ("AAS" or the "Company") is a specialized anesthesia services provider operating exclusively in the ambulatory surgery center (ASC) market across Michigan and Indiana. Founded in Michigan in 2009 and expanded into Indiana in 2022, AAS provides comprehensive anesthesia staffing (CRNAs and MDAs), billing, and operational support to ASCs under long-term evergreen contracts.

The company operates in a highly attractive market characterized by converging secular tailwinds: an aging population driving increased surgical demand, an accelerating shift from hospital-based to outpatient surgical procedures, and a worsening national shortage of anesthesia providers. As of 2025, AAS serves 29 ASC locations with a flexible staffing model comprising 52 anesthesiologists (MDAs) and 147 CRNAs, supported by a lean back-office team of 5 employees.

AAS has demonstrated strong growth momentum, scaling from serving 16 ASCs in 2020 to 29 by end of 2025—an 81% increase in just five years. The company's financial performance reflects this growth trajectory, with 2025 estimated revenue of $28 million and EBITDA of $4.6 million (16.4% margin). With Northern Shore Capital's acquisition at $34 million (7.9x EBITDA) closing in November 2025, AAS is positioned to accelerate growth through professionalized infrastructure, expanded geographic footprint, and enhanced operational capabilities.

### Core Value Proposition

AAS has established itself as the **employer of choice** in a labor-constrained anesthesia market by solving a critical pain point that traditional hospital-based anesthesia providers struggle with: work-life balance. The company's exclusive focus on ASCs enables it to offer providers a compelling lifestyle proposition—no nights, no weekends, no call shifts—in an industry plagued by burnout where 61% of anesthesiologists report willingness to accept reduced compensation for improved work-life balance.

This differentiated positioning creates a virtuous cycle:
- **For Providers:** Attractive work environment drives superior recruitment and retention despite industry-wide shortages
- **For ASCs:** Access to reliable, high-quality anesthesia coverage with flexible staffing that scales to demand
- **For AAS:** Ability to aggregate a large, flexible labor pool (including significant PRN capacity) that enables rapid contract ramp-up and operational efficiency

The company's contract structure provides downside protection through labor floor guarantees while creating upside potential through improved revenue cycle management (RCM) performance. Approximately 80% of revenue comes from collection-based income with contractual minimum payments, while 20% derives from fee-for-service arrangements.

### Market Position and Competitive Landscape

The U.S. anesthesia services market was valued at $27.4 billion in 2024 and is projected to grow at 7.9% CAGR through 2031, driven by demographic trends, technological innovation, and the shift to outpatient care. Within this broader market, the ASC segment represents a particularly attractive opportunity:

**Market Dynamics Favoring AAS:**
- **Supply-Demand Imbalance:** 78% of facilities report anesthesia staffing shortages as of end-2022 (up from 35% pre-pandemic); projected shortfall of 6,300 anesthesiologists by 2036
- **ASC Market Growth:** U.S. ASC market growing at 5.7% CAGR, with procedures shifting from hospitals to lower-cost outpatient settings
- **Outsourcing Trend:** 80% of hospitals provide stipend payments to anesthesia providers; ASCs are "kings of outsourcing" due to variable demand patterns that make in-house staffing economically inefficient
- **Market Fragmentation:** Only 15 anesthesia organizations employ 500+ physicians nationally; local markets remain highly fragmented with opportunity for consolidation

**Competitive Positioning:**
AAS competes in Michigan and Indiana markets against both physician-owned groups and PE-backed consolidators (NorthStar Anesthesia with 4,000+ clinicians, US Anesthesia Partners with 5,000+ clinicians). The company's competitive advantages include:

1. **ASC-Only Focus:** Unlike competitors serving both hospitals and ASCs, AAS's exclusive ASC positioning creates superior provider lifestyle and enables operational specialization
2. **Flexible PRN Model:** Large pool of PRN contractors (132 across both states) enables efficient scheduling and rapid scaling for new contracts
3. **Contract Structure Innovation:** Labor floor + true-up mechanisms provide downside protection while incentivizing RCM excellence
4. **Local Market Expertise:** Deep relationships in Detroit and Indianapolis markets with proven land-and-expand track record

### Strategic Priorities

Northern Shore Capital's value creation strategy centers on **five strategic pillars** that will drive AAS from $4.3M EBITDA (2025) to a target of $20M+ EBITDA by 2030:

1. **Retain Current Contracts:** Minimize churn through enhanced ASC satisfaction tracking, relationship management, and reliable coverage delivery
2. **Grow ASC Portfolio in Existing Markets:** Build repeatable growth engine through improved pipeline management, management company partnerships, and margin-accretive contract structuring
3. **Build Best-in-Class RCM Function:** Achieve full visibility and control over billing/collections to reduce ASC subsidy reliance and enable at-risk contract positioning
4. **Expand into New Geographies:** Target 3+ high-reimbursement states with deliberate market entry playbook
5. **Regulatory & Compliance Excellence:** Scale compliance infrastructure proactively to support growth and mitigate risk

The immediate focus areas for 2026 include: hiring a CFO and professionalizing finance function, bringing RCM in-house or partnering with superior vendor (VBRCM), implementing CRM for pipeline management, developing ASC satisfaction scorecard, and establishing market entry playbook for geographic expansion.

- Higher volume and more consistent scheduling needs
- Examples: IU Health facilities, Solaris-owned centers

**2. Single-Specialty ASCs**
- Focused on one specialty (e.g., orthopedics, ophthalmology)
- Often surgeon-owned or affiliated with specialty groups
- More predictable case mix but potentially more variable volume
- Examples: Ortho-focused centers, eye surgery centers

**3. Management Company-Affiliated ASCs**
- ASCs owned or managed by aggregators (USPI, Surgery Partners, SCA, Solaris)
- Represent land-and-expand opportunities
- May have standardized vendor selection processes
- AAS currently serves IU Health (7 centers), Solaris (3 centers), and various independent management companies

#### Current Customer Base (End of 2025)

**Michigan: 16 ASCs**
- **Revenue/EBITDA (2025E):** $12.3M / $1.7M (13.8% margin)
- **Geographic Concentration:** Metro Detroit area with some presence in other Michigan markets
- **Contract Mix:** Higher proportion of fee-for-service and collections-based arrangements
- **Payor Risk Profile:** Higher payor risk due to reliance on insurance reimbursements
- **Provider Allocation:** 131 total providers (16 MDAs, 110 CRNAs, 5 office staff)

**Indiana: 13 ASCs**
- **Revenue/EBITDA (2025E):** $15.7M / $2.9M (18.5% margin)
- **Geographic Concentration:** Indianapolis area (7 IU Health centers) plus Fort Wayne, Evansville, Lafayette
- **Contract Mix:** Predominantly true-up + management fee structures
- **Payor Risk Profile:** Lower payor risk; ASCs cover labor costs regardless of collections
- **Provider Allocation:** 78 total providers (36 MDAs, 37 CRNAs, shared office staff)
- **Key Innovation:** Introduced CRNA-focused model to IU Health (previously MDA-only)

#### Customer Concentration Analysis

**Significant Concentration Risk - IU Health:**
- 7 of 13 Indiana ASCs (54% of Indiana facilities)
- Represents substantial portion of Indiana revenue
- **Mitigants:**
  - Evergreen 3-5 year contracts with discrete agreements per ASC
  - Strong relationship; IU Health proactively sought out AAS
  - Contract performance >98% of allowables when excluding patient balances
  - IU Health currently serves only 7 of its 17 total ASCs, representing expansion opportunity
  - Model assumes IU Health churn in downside case; retention represents significant upside

**Solaris Risk - Acquisition by Cardinal Health:**
- 3 Michigan ASCs under Solaris ownership
- Potential risk of in-sourcing post-acquisition
- **Base case conservatively assumes all 3 Solaris centers churn at renewal (2028)**
- No churn to date; contracts not scheduled for renewal until 2028

### 2.3 Revenue Model and Pricing Approach

AAS operates four distinct contract structures, each with different risk/reward profiles:

#### Contract Type 1: Pure Billing & Collections (14% of 2024 Revenue)
- **Number of ASCs:** 1
- **Structure:** AAS collects all insurance reimbursements; no labor floor guarantee
- **Revenue Driver:** Insurance payments only
- **Risk Profile:** High payor risk; fully exposed to collection performance and reimbursement rate changes
- **Pricing:** Based on standard ASA billing units and time-based charges
- **Status:** Legacy model; no new contracts being signed with this structure

#### Contract Type 2: Fee for Service (22% of 2024 Revenue)
- **Number of ASCs:** 8
- **Structure:** Fixed daily or monthly fees paid directly by ASC
- **Revenue Driver:** Service days provided
- **Risk Profile:** No payor risk; guaranteed payment regardless of insurance collections
- **Pricing:** Negotiated per-day or per-case rates
- **Contract Terms:** 1-3 years with regular renegotiation for labor cost increases
- **Example Rates:** Varies by market and provider type

#### Contract Type 3: Billing & Collections + Labor Floor (5% of 2024 Revenue)
- **Number of ASCs:** 7
- **Structure:** AAS collects insurance reimbursements; ASC guarantees minimum monthly payment (labor floor)
- **Revenue Driver:** Greater of (a) insurance collections or (b) guaranteed labor floor
- **Risk Profile:** Downside protected by labor floor; upside from collections exceeding floor
- **Pricing:** Labor floor set to cover provider wages plus margin; typically includes:
  - CRNA floors: $1,450 - $2,000 per FTE per day
  - MDA floors: $2,725 - $3,200 per FTE per day
- **Contract Terms:** 1-3 years with renegotiation provisions
- **Strategic Value:** Enables at-risk positioning while maintaining margin protection

#### Contract Type 4: True-Up Mechanism + Management Fee (59% of 2024 Revenue - Largest Segment)
- **Number of ASCs:** 13 (predominantly Indiana)
- **Structure:** Monthly true-up process ensures ASC pays combined labor cost + management fee if collections fall short
- **Revenue Driver:** Guaranteed labor costs + management fee markup
- **Risk Profile:** Minimal payor risk; ASC absorbs collection shortfall
- **Pricing Components:**
  - Contractually fixed annual labor costs per provider FTE
  - Management fee percentage on top of labor costs
  - **Annual Escalators:** Minimum 3% increases built into contracts
- **Contract Terms:** 3-5 years with automatic renewal provisions
- **Example Structure:**
  - Labor floors: CRNA $1,450-$2,000/day, MDA $2,725-$3,200/day
  - Management fee: Percentage-based (exact percentages proprietary)
  - True-up: Monthly reconciliation of collections vs. guaranteed minimum
- **Strategic Value:** Most attractive structure providing:
  - Predictable, recurring revenue
  - Downside protection
  - Built-in margin escalators
  - Long-term partnership structure

#### Pricing Strategy Evolution

**Current State:**
- Mix of contract types reflecting company's evolution
- Legacy pure billing contracts being phased out
- Fee-for-service provides stability but limited upside
- Labor floor and true-up models align incentives while protecting margins

**Future State (Northern Shore Strategy):**
- **Preferred Structure:** Labor floor + true-up with management fees
- **Pricing Guardrails:** Establishing minimum floor levels before contract signing
- **Annual Escalators:** Targeting greater of labor cost increases or 3.5% annually
- **Margin Protection:** Regular MOR review of margin trends by ASC
- **Strategic Filters:** Avoid high government payor concentration unless offset by other factors

**Operational Infrastructure:**
- **Back Office:** 5 employees (critically under-resourced)
- **Work Model:** Fully remote
- **Shared Services:** Michigan and Indiana operate with unified back office
- **Technology Stack:** Minimal/basic (see Technology section for details)

#### Efficiency and Utilization Indicators

**Staffing Efficiency (Demonstrated Capabilities):**
- **Rapid Ramp-Up:** IU Health expansion from 0 to 7 centers (2022-2024) demonstrates ability to scale quickly

   - Share performance data and collections reports proactively

2. **Coverage Reliability Excellence**
   - Track and optimize on-time case coverage percentage
   - Ensure consistent, timely coverage every single day
   - Minimize unprofessional or unfamiliar provider issues
   - Build provider continuity where valued by surgeons/administrators
   - Develop bench strength to handle scheduling challenges

3. **Minimize ASC Subsidy Reliance**
   - Improve RCM performance to maximize collections (see Pillar #3)
   - Proactively communicate with ASCs when subsidies result from their actions (low case volume)
   - Provide ASCs with reports on case volume, collections, margins
   - Optimize staffing costs by center where possible
   - Consider provider mix adjustments to lower cost-to-serve for subsidized centers

**Key Metrics:**
- Contract renewal rate (target: >95%)

3. **Execute Disciplined Market Entry**
   - **Minimum Viable Scale:**
     - Determine minimum contract size to target
     - Identify minimum number of contracts to justify standalone labor force
     - Define profitability threshold for new market
   - **Management Company-Led Entry:**
     - If management company wants to pull AAS into new market with lower reimbursement, use management fee construct to achieve target margins
     - Balance strategic value of management company relationship vs. margin requirements
   - **Dedicated Launch Team:**
     - Consider dedicated "new market launch team" excluding providers
     - Determine if separate scheduler needed for new markets

## 7. Critical Success Factors

### 7.1 Top 5-7 Factors Essential for Strategic Goal Achievement

#### 1. Provider Recruitment and Retention in Worsening Shortage Environment

**Why Critical:**
The entire business model depends on access to anesthesia providers in a market facing structural supply-demand imbalance (projected 6,300 anesthesiologist shortage by 2036, 78% of facilities reporting shortages). Without reliable provider access, AAS cannot:
- Staff existing contracts (risking churn)
- Ramp up new contracts (limiting growth)
- Enter new markets (preventing geographic expansion)

**Current Strengths:**
- ASC-only positioning provides superior work-life balance vs hospital-based competitors
- Above-market compensation (60-65th percentile)
- Flexible employment options (FT, PT, PRN)
- Proven track record (IU Health 0→7 centers ramp)
- CRNA program relationships and university recruiting

**Enablers Required:**
- **Dedicated recruiter** hired by mid-2026 with healthcare staffing expertise
- **ATS implementation** to systematically manage candidate pipeline
- **Provider referral incentive program** (compensation for successful referrals)
- **Enhanced digital marketing** (job ads, social media, email nurture campaigns)
- **University relationships** formalized with recurring campus visits and sponsorships
- **Competitive compensation monitoring** to maintain 60-65th percentile positioning
- **Provider engagement initiatives** (annual events, recognition programs, career development)

**Measurement:**
- Provider recruitment pipeline: 20+ qualified candidates at all times
- Time-to-fill: <60 days average (excluding credentialing)
- Offer acceptance rate: >80%
- Provider referral rate: 40% of new hires from referrals
- Turnover rate (FT/PT): <10% annually

---

#### 2. Revenue Cycle Management Excellence and Collections Optimization

**Why Critical:**
RCM performance directly determines:
- **Margin expansion:** Every 1% improvement in net collection rate = ~$280K annual EBITDA at current scale
- **ASC satisfaction:** High subsidies (collections below labor floor) create churn risk
- **Competitive positioning:** Strong RCM enables at-risk contract structures competitors can't match
- **Growth enablement:** Confident RCM is prerequisite for aggressive new contract pursuit

**Current Weaknesses:**
- 3% EDI configuration error rate (coding mistakes)
- 3% patient eligibility denials
- Missing code utilization (e.g., 99100 for age >70)
- Insufficient claim-level visibility from Physicians Choice
- Patient balance collections underperforming
- No in-house RCM expertise

**Enablers Required:**
- **VBRCM migration or in-house build** completed by Q3 2026 with real-time claim visibility
- **Coding audit program** (quarterly samples, annual comprehensive)
- **EMR implementation** (2027) to improve documentation accuracy
- **Payor contracting capability** (in-house expert or consultant) to negotiate better rates
- **Patient collections vendor upgrade** or process improvement
- **RCM dashboards** with daily/weekly visibility to collections, denials, A/R aging
- **Clean claim process** redesign to eliminate EDI errors

**Measurement:**
- Clean claim rate: >95% (from ~94% baseline with errors)
- Denial rate: <5% (from ~6% baseline)
- Net collection rate: 5-10% improvement over 12-18 months
- A/R days over 120: Minimize aging balances
- Bad debt as % revenue: <3%
- ASC subsidy reduction: <20% of ASCs requiring >10% subsidy

---

#### 3. Contract Retention and ASC Relationship Management

**Why Critical:**
Churn disproportionately affects growth. Losing one $2M contract requires winning 1.5-2 new contracts to offset (considering sales costs, ramp time, and risk). With 7 contracts (24.6% of 2026 revenue) up for renewal in 2026 and ongoing renewal cycles, retention is existential.

**Current Gaps:**
- No formal ASC satisfaction tracking
- No relationship manager assignment
- Ad hoc communication without strategic cadence
- Reactive rather than proactive engagement
- No early warning system for at-risk contracts
- High subsidies at some ASCs create vulnerability

**Enablers Required:**
- **ASC satisfaction scorecard** (punctuality, reliability, professionalism) with monthly/quarterly cadence
- **Relationship manager assignment** to top 10 ASCs
- **Annual review meetings** scheduled 6+ months ahead of renewal dates
- **Performance reporting** shared proactively with ASCs (case volume, collections, efficiency)
- **On-time coverage tracking** (<98% triggers corrective action)
- **RCM improvement** to reduce subsidy reliance
- **Executive engagement** (Chris/Mark quarterly touchpoints with key administrators)

**Measurement:**
- Contract renewal rate: >95% of contracts where AAS seeks renewal
- Administrator feedback score: >4.5 / 5.0 average
- On-time case coverage %: >98%
- Subsidy reduction: Trend down labor floor subsidies over 12 months
- Early warning: Identify at-risk contracts 6+ months before renewal for intervention

---

#### 4. Professionalized Infrastructure and Founder Leverage

**Why Critical:**
Current infrastructure (5-person back office, no CFO, minimal systems, founder-does-everything model) cannot scale to $100M revenue. Founder bandwidth is the bottleneck for growth. Without professionalization:
- Strategic initiatives don't get executed (RCM improvement, pipeline management, new markets)
- Financial visibility is insufficient for NSC and lender requirements
- Compliance risks grow without dedicated oversight
- Founders burn out and retention risk increases

**Current State:**
- All strategic and tactical decisions flow through Chris and Mark
- No CFO = limited financial visibility, no MOR process, no margin analytics
- No recruiter = founders sourcing providers ad hoc
- No CGO/BizDev = founders handling all sales activities
- QuickBooks insufficient for PE-backed multi-entity company
- No CRM, limited BI, minimal automation

**Enablers Required:**
- **CFO hire by December 2026:** Financial strategy, MOR development, margin analysis, lender relations, ERP implementation, M&A support
- **Dedicated recruiter by mid-2026:** Provider pipeline management, university relations, referral program, ATS management
- **HR personnel (2026-2027):** Benefits, compliance, employee relations, culture development
- **Chief Growth Officer (2027-2028 if warranted):** Sales leadership, pipeline management, new market expansion, CRM optimization
- **ERP implementation (Q1 2027):** ASC-level P&L, budgeting, forecasting, consolidated reporting
- **CRM implementation (Q3 2026):** Pipeline visibility, conversion optimization, sales process discipline
- **Enhanced RCM platform (Q3 2026):** Real-time visibility, margin improvement
- **Process documentation:** Playbooks for onboarding ASCs, entering markets, sourcing providers
- **Founder role evolution:** Chris focuses on strategic partnerships and high-value sales; Mark focuses on operational excellence and quality; both leverage professional team vs doing everything

**Measurement:**
- CFO onboarded and effective: MOR process launched by Q1 2027, ASC-level margin visibility achieved
- G&A scaling appropriately: Corporate overhead <15% of revenue while building capabilities
- Founder satisfaction: Chris and Mark report increased focus on strategic priorities vs tactical firefighting
- System adoption: CRM daily active usage, ERP monthly close within 5 days, RCM dashboards reviewed weekly

---

#### 5. Disciplined Growth with Margin Protection

**Why Critical:**
Revenue growth without margin discipline destroys value. Aggressive ASC additions at low/negative margins dilute EBITDA and jeopardize earnout achievement and exit valuation. The temptation to win contracts at any price to hit growth targets must be balanced with profitability discipline.

**Risks:**
- Accepting low-margin contracts to hit ASC count targets
- Entering markets with poor reimbursement rates for strategic reasons
- Failing to renegotiate renewals with appropriate escalators
- Overinvesting in G&A ahead of revenue realization
- Dilutive M&A at high multiples without clear synergies

**Enablers Required:**
- **Pricing guardrails:** Documented minimum labor floor levels by market and provider type
- **Contract approval process:** CFO review and approval required for any contract below margin thresholds
- **Annual escalator requirements:** Greater of labor inflation or 3.5% minimum in all new contracts
- **Margin review in MOR:** Monthly review of margin trends by ASC; corrective action for deteriorating margins
- **Ideal Customer Profile (ICP):** Data-driven ICP based on win/loss analysis and margin performance
- **Market entry financial model:** ROI analysis required for new geography entry; minimum contract count and margin thresholds
- **M&A discipline:** Valuation frameworks, synergy requirements, integration playbooks
- **Budget and forecast accountability:** Variance analysis with explanations; course correction for underperformance

**Measurement:**
- EBITDA margin: Maintain/expand from 16.4% to 20%+ by 2030
- New contract margin analysis: All new contracts meet minimum gross margin targets (18%+ for Indiana-type, 13%+ for Michigan-type)
- Gross profit achievement: $9.5M (2026) and $11.5M (2027) earnout targets
- Contract mix evolution: Shift to 70-80%+ true-up/management fee structure (from 59% baseline)
- G&A efficiency: Corporate overhead <15% of revenue while scaling capabilities

---

#### 6. Geographic Expansion Execution with Repeatable Playbook

**Why Critical:**
Achieving $100M revenue and $20M EBITDA requires successful entry into 3-4 new high-reimbursement markets. Without successful geographic expansion:
- Revenue remains concentrated in Michigan and Indiana (payor and market risk)
- Platform lacks scale to attract strategic buyers at premium multiples
- Reimbursement rate mix doesn't improve (margin expansion limited)
- Competitive moat remains regional vs national

**Challenges:**
- Indiana expansion succeeded but not systematically documented
- No repeatable market entry playbook (staffing, GTM, payor negotiation, operations)
- Target market selection criteria not formalized (reimbursement, competition, labor, regulation)
- Resource requirements unclear (dedicated scheduler, billing support, provider bench)
- First-mover challenges in markets with no AAS presence or relationships

**Enablers Required:**
- **Market attractiveness scorecard:** Reimbursement rates, market saturation, labor supply, payor concentration, CON laws, regulatory environment
- **Target market selection:** Top 3-4 states identified by Q2 2026 (California and Oregon preliminary frontrunners)
- **Market entry playbook:** Documented process covering:
  - Staffing strategy (provider recruitment, minimum bench, local consultants)
  - Go-to-market approach (trade shows, RFPs, management company intros, positioning)
  - Payor contracting (timing, negotiation tactics, minimum rates)
  - Operational setup (state licensing, compliance, scheduling, billing)
- **Dedicated new market launch team:** Potentially dedicated resources (scheduler, recruiter, BizDev) vs spreading existing team thin
- **Pilot market (2027):** Execute first new market launch with disciplined approach; document learnings
- **Scaling approach (2028-2030):** Leverage playbook for 3 additional markets

**Measurement:**
- Market #1 launch by 2027 with 2-3 anchor contracts
- 3+ new markets operational by 2030 (base case); 4+ (expected case)
- New market profitability: Achieve positive EBITDA within 18 months of first contract
- New market reimbursement: Average reimbursement rates 10-20%+ higher than Michigan/Indiana baseline
- Time to operational readiness: <120 days from market entry decision to first ASC coverage
- New market contract pace: 2-3 contracts per market per year

---

#### 7. Northern Shore Partnership Leverage and Alignment

**Why Critical:**
AAS selected Northern Shore as partner over other buyers due to alignment on growth vision, cultural fit, and Michigan-based relationship. Maximizing value from this partnership (capital access, operational expertise, professional network, M&A capability) is critical to achieving $20M+ EBITDA target. Conversely, misalignment or lack of leverage could result in underperformance and strained relationship.

**Partnership Value Creation Levers:**
- **Capital Access:** $5M growth capital at close + ability to fund accelerated contract growth and infrastructure investment beyond initial budget
- **Operational Expertise:** Scott Barry's Centria Healthcare scaling experience; repeatable value creation playbooks from prior healthcare services investments
- **Talent Network:** CFO candidates, board members (Nicholas Schmidt, etc.), industry SMEs, advisors
- **Professional Services:** Legal (Mayer Brown), IT, compliance, HR infrastructure support
- **M&A Capability:** Sourcing tuck-in acquisitions, integration playbooks, valuation expertise
- **Strategic Guidance:** Board governance, MOR process, KPI frameworks, exit positioning

**Enablers Required:**
- **Governance Structure:** Monthly or quarterly board meetings with clear agenda, pre-reads, action items
- **MOR Process:** Monthly operating reviews with Northern Shore participation; KPI dashboards and variance analysis
- **Open Communication:** Proactive sharing of challenges, opportunities, and strategic questions vs waiting for board meetings
- **Leverage Resources:** Actively tap Northern Shore network for talent, advisors, vendor recommendations
- **Alignment on Strategy:** Ensure major strategic decisions (new markets, M&A, large investments) have NSC input and alignment
- **Cultural Fit:** Maintain AAS culture and provider-centric values while professionalizing; NSC supports vs imposes change
- **Founder Engagement:** Chris and Mark actively engage with Scott Barry and NSC team; view as partners vs overseers

**Measurement:**
- Board meeting effectiveness: Structured agendas, actionable outcomes, strategic value-add
- Talent leverage: CFO, recruiter, CGO hired with NSC network support
- Strategic initiative progress: Value creation pillars executed on timeline with NSC support
- Financial performance: Earnout targets achieved, EBITDA growth trajectory on track
- Relationship satisfaction: Founders and NSC both report strong, collaborative partnership

### 7.2 Risks and Mitigation Strategies

#### Risk: IU Health Concentration and Potential Churn

**Description:**
7 of 13 Indiana ASCs (54%) are IU Health facilities. Loss of IU Health relationship would be catastrophic to Indiana operations and company performance.

**Mitigants:**
- **Strong Relationship:** IU Health proactively sought AAS; relationship remains strong
- **Performance:** Collections >98% of allowables (excluding patient balances); meeting contract specifications
- **Long-Term Contracts:** 3-5 year evergreen terms with discrete contracts per ASC (not system-wide)
- **Growth Opportunity:** Serving only 7 of 17 IU Health ASCs; expansion potential vs churn risk
- **Diversification:** Pipeline of non-IU Health opportunities significantly reduces concentration over hold period
- **Downside Case:** Model includes all IU Health churn scenario; still maintains profitability

**Status:** Managed risk; diversification progressing

---

#### Risk: Solaris Cardinal Health Acquisition and In-Sourcing

**Description:**
Cardinal Health acquired Solaris, which owns 3 Michigan ASCs under contract with AAS. Risk of anesthesia in-sourcing post-acquisition.

**Mitigants:**
- **Conservative Assumption:** Base case model assumes all 3 Solaris contracts churn at renewal (2028)
- **Long Runway:** Contracts not up for renewal until 2028 (3+ years)
- **Management Turnover Potential:** Strategy pivots or management changes could result in AAS retention
- **Upside Scenario:** Any Solaris retention is upside to base case (adds 0.5x MOIC if retained)

**Status:** Conservatively underwritten; monitoring situation

---

#### Risk: RCM Performance and ASC Subsidy Reliance

**Description:**
If collections remain poor and ASCs continue heavily subsidizing coverage (paying labor floors with minimal insurance reimbursement), risk of contract renegotiation at lower floors or outright churn.

**Mitigants:**
- **VBRCM Migration:** Real-time visibility enabling proactive collection improvement
- **Coding Audits:** Identifying and fixing underbilling (e.g., 99100 code for age >70)
- **EDI Error Elimination:** Reducing 3% rejection rate through process improvement
- **Patient Collections Enhancement:** Upgrading vendor or process for patient balances
- **Payor Contracting:** Building density to negotiate better rates
- **ASC Communication:** Proactive sharing of challenges (low volume, payor mix) vs surprising ASCs with subsidies

**Status:** High priority initiative; VBRCM migration in progress

---

#### Risk: Provider Supply Shortage and Recruiting Challenges

**Description:**
National shortage of anesthesiologists (projected 6,300 by 2036) and CRNAs could limit AAS's ability to staff existing and new contracts, constraining growth.

**Mitigants:**
- **Employer of Choice Positioning:** ASC-only model offers superior work-life balance
- **Above-Market Compensation:** 60-65th percentile pay; maintain competitiveness
- **CRNA Program Relationships:** University recruiting pipeline
- **Referral Network:** Provider-to-provider referrals (incentivized)
- **Historical Track Record:** Demonstrated ability to recruit (IU Health ramp, 7 new ASCs in 2025)
- **Flexible Employment:** FT, PT, PRN options accommodate provider preferences
- **Dedicated Recruiter:** Professional recruiting vs ad hoc founder-led

**Status:** Proactive mitigation in place; dedicated recruiter hire planned mid-2026

---

#### Risk: Regulatory and Compliance Violations

**Description:**
Failure of compliance audit or regulatory violation (HIPAA breach, billing fraud, licensing issue) could result in millions in penalties, contract losses, and reputational damage.

**Mitigants:**
- **Formal Compliance Program:** Health Law Partners handbook, policies, procedures
- **Dedicated Compliance Officer:** Oversight and monitoring
- **Provider Background Checks:** Initial and ongoing (OIG, sex offender, licenses)
- **Coding Audits:** Quarterly samples and annual comprehensive audits
- **HIPAA Program:** Technical, administrative, physical safeguards; training; breach preparedness
- **Legal Counsel:** Proactive engagement of healthcare legal experts (Health Law Partners, Mayer Brown)
- **Self-Disclosure Process:** Identified violations self-disclosed vs hiding and compounding risk
- **Pre-Close Remediation:** Michigan PLLC conversion, 1099→W2 conversion, compliance handbook all completed/in-progress

**Status:** High priority; program launch Q1-Q2 2026

---

#### Risk: Young Management Team and Operational Scaling Challenges

**Description:**
Founders successfully scaled to $28M but lack experience operating at $50M+ scale. Risk of execution gaps, decision bottlenecks, founder burnout, or strategic missteps.

**Mitigants:**
- **Northern Shore Support:** Scott Barry's operational expertise and governance oversight
- **Professional Management Team:** CFO, recruiter, HR, potentially CGO to provide functional expertise
- **Process and Systems:** CRM, ERP, RCM, playbooks reduce reliance on founder heroics
- **Founder Development:** Exposure to NSC portfolio company best practices, peer CEOs, board governance
- **Equity Alignment:** $8M rollover ensures Chris and Mark remain highly motivated and committed

**Status:** Mitigated through professionalization plan

---

#### Risk: Reimbursement Rate Compression

**Description:**
Commercial payor reimbursement rates could decline over time, impacting margins on collections-based contracts.

**Mitigants:**
- **Limited Exposure:** Only 23% of revenue directly tied to payor risk (pure collections and above-floor)
- **Contract Structure:** Shift toward labor floor + true-up protects downside
- **Annual Escalators:** Built-in 3-3.5% increases in newer contracts offset reimbursement pressure
- **Geographic Expansion:** Target high-reimbursement markets (CA, OR) to improve overall rate mix
- **Payor Contracting:** Build scale to negotiate favorable rates vs accepting declining rates passively
- **Government Payor Management:** 20% government payor mix; avoid high-concentration contracts

**Status:** Managed through contract structuring and expansion strategy

---

## 8. Appendices

### Appendix A: Definitions and Acronyms

#### Industry-Specific Terms

**Ambulatory Surgery Center (ASC):** Outpatient facility where surgical procedures not requiring overnight hospital stay are performed. Also called outpatient surgery center.

**Anesthesia Staffing Model:** The structure of anesthesia provider coverage at a facility. Common models include:
- **Medical Direction Model:** Anesthesiologist (MDA) medically directs multiple CRNAs
- **Care Team Model (ACT):** Anesthesiologist supervises up to 4 CRNAs concurrently
- **CRNA-Only Model:** CRNAs practice independently (where state law permits)
- **Anesthesiologist-Only Model:** MDAs provide all anesthesia care

**ASA Units (Base Units):** American Society of Anesthesiologists relative value system for anesthesia billing. Each procedure assigned base units reflecting complexity; additional units for time, modifiers, patient condition.

**Care Team Model / Anesthesia Care Team (ACT):** Model where anesthesiologist medically directs up to 4 CRNAs providing concurrent anesthesia care. Allows leveraging of MDA expertise across multiple cases.

**Certificate of Need (CON):** State regulatory requirement for approval before healthcare facilities can be built or expanded. States with CON laws restrict ASC development; non-CON states have more robust de novo opportunities.

**Clean Claim Rate:** Percentage of insurance claims submitted without errors that are accepted for processing on first submission (vs rejected for errors and requiring resubmission).

**Corporate Practice of Medicine (CPOM):** Legal doctrine in many states prohibiting non-physicians from owning medical practices or exercising control over medical decisions. Requires structures separating clinical (physician-owned practice entity) from non-clinical (management company).

**CRNA (Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetist):** Advanced practice registered nurse with specialized graduate training in anesthesia. Can administer anesthesia independently in many states or under physician supervision in others.

**Denial Rate:** Percentage of insurance claims denied by payors requiring appeal or resubmission. High denial rates indicate billing process issues.

**Evergreen Contract:** Contract that automatically renews for successive terms unless either party provides notice of termination. Provides revenue predictability vs fixed-term contracts requiring renegotiation.

**FTE (Full-Time Equivalent):** Measure of provider workload. 1.0 FTE = full-time provider working standard hours (e.g., 40 hours/week or 180 days/year in AAS models).

**Labor Floor:** Contractual minimum monthly payment from ASC to anesthesia provider, regardless of insurance collections. Provides downside protection for provider; ASC "subsidizes" if collections below floor.

**Locum Tenens / Locums:** Temporary provider filling in for staff shortages, leaves, or volume surges. Typically 1099 contractors with higher hourly rates than permanent staff.

   - 20 slides covering 5 value creation pillars
   - Focus areas: contract retention, ASC portfolio growth, RCM excellence, geographic expansion, compliance
   - Detailed questions and discussion prompts for each pillar
   - KPI proposals organized by value creation theme
   - Pipeline tracking framework (Exhibit A)
   - Company vision: $100M+ revenue, $20M+ EBITDA by 2030

2. **NSC - Underwriting Memo_AAS (November 2025).pptx**
   - Northern Shore Capital investment committee memo
   - 70 slides covering comprehensive due diligence and investment thesis
   - Sections: Executive Summary, Company Overview, Valuation, Risks, Sector Overview, Financing, Legal, Due Diligence
   - Financial projections: Base Case, Expected Case, Downside Case
   - Market analysis: anesthesia services market, ASC market, competitive landscape
   - Due diligence findings: IU relationship, compliance, RCM performance, legal structure
   - Transaction structure: $34M cash at close, $4.5M earnout, $8M seller rollover, 3.8x leverage
   - Northern Shore advantage: sector expertise, founder-friendly approach, resources

#### Key Assumptions Made Where Data Was Unclear

**1. KPI Frequency and Ownership:**
- Source documents identified many metrics but did not always specify measurement frequency or ownership
- **Assumption:** Assigned frequency (daily/weekly/monthly/quarterly/annual) based on metric type and industry best practices
- **Assumption:** Assigned ownership to logical roles (CFO for financial, COO for operational, CEO for strategic) based on typical healthcare services company structure

**2. Current Baselines for New Metrics:**
- Many proposed KPIs (on-time coverage %, administrator feedback score, pipeline metrics, RCM metrics) are not currently tracked
- **Assumption:** Marked as "Not currently tracked" where source documents provided no baseline
- **Assumption:** Targets set based on industry benchmarks (e.g., >95% clean claim rate, >98% on-time coverage) where sources were silent

**3. Technology Initiative Timelines:**
- Source documents mentioned technology needs (EMR, CRM, VBRCM migration) but limited detail on implementation timelines
- **Assumption:** Estimated timelines based on typical healthcare IT implementation cycles (e.g., ERP 9-12 months, CRM 6 months, EMR 12-18 months)
- **Assumption:** Sequenced initiatives based on dependencies and resource constraints (e.g., CFO hire before ERP, RCM before EMR)

**4. New Contract Revenue and Margin Assumptions:**
- Source documents provided examples of specific new contracts but not comprehensive modeling assumptions for all future contracts
- **Assumption:** Used averages from existing contracts and specific examples (e.g., 2 CRNA + 1 MDA staffing, labor floor ranges) to model typical new contract profile
- **Assumption:** Michigan margin baseline 13-15%, Indiana 18-20%, new markets 20%+ based on reimbursement rate differentials

**5. Provider Compensation Benchmarks:**
- Source documents provided market compensation percentile ranges (60-65th) and specific examples
- **Assumption:** Used Salary.com data and expert call insights to estimate specific compensation levels by market and percentile
- **Assumption:** AAS pays approximately 50th-65th percentile based on role and market

**6. G&A Build-Out Details:**
- Source documents indicated $2M+ G&A additions and specific roles (CFO, recruiter, HR) but not comprehensive org chart or comp levels
- **Assumption:** Estimated headcount and compensation based on typical PE-backed healthcare services companies at similar scale
- **Assumption:** Corporate overhead scaling to support $100M revenue likely requires 15-20 corporate FTEs (from current 5)

**7. Geographic Expansion Market Selection:**
- Source documents mentioned California and Oregon as attractive but limited detail on scoring methodology
- **Assumption:** Equal weighting of reimbursement rates and market entrance difficulty per Chartis methodology
- **Assumption:** Additional considerations (CON laws, payor concentration, labor supply, regulatory environment) identified but not quantitatively scored

**8. Earnout Mechanics:**
- Source documents specified gross profit targets ($9.5M, $11.5M) and 85% threshold with scaling
- **Assumption:** Interpreted "25% floor at 85% of target" as earning 25% of earnout at 85% achievement, scaling linearly to 100% at 100% achievement
- **Example:** If 2026 GP = $8.75M (92% of $9.5M target), earnout = ~58% of $2.5M = $1.45M

**9. Compliance Program Scope:**
- Health Law Partners engagement mentioned but deliverable not included in source documents
- **Assumption:** Typical comprehensive compliance program includes policies for HIPAA, billing/coding, AKS/Stark, fraud/waste/abuse, provider credentialing, training, auditing based on industry standards
- **Assumption:** Annual compliance budget ~$100-200K for audits, background checks, training, third-party support

**10. Technology Costs:**
- Limited detail on technology budget in source documents
- **Assumption:** ERP implementation $200-500K; CRM $50-150K; EMR $300-600K; RCM % of collections; enhanced marketing $100K+/year
- **Assumption:** Ongoing technology costs (licenses, support) ~$300-500K annually at scale

- Technology implementation timelines (based on typical projects)
- G&A build-out details (based on comparable companies)
- Provider compensation levels (based on market data and ranges provided)
- RCM performance metrics (partial data from VBRCM preliminary report mentioned)
