Ambulatory Anesthesia Solutions (“AAS” or the “Company”) provides anesthesia staffing, billing, and operational support to Ambulatory Surgery Centers (“ASCs”) in Michigan and Indiana under long-term evergreen contracts.
The outpatient surgery market is experiencing robust growth, driven by patient preference, cost efficiency, and payer trends shifting procedures away from hospitals. At the same time, a worsening national shortage of anesthesia providers has created a structural supply-demand imbalance. AAS has a proven ability to recruit and retain talent, offering a compelling value proposition to ASCs and providers alike.
With Northern Shore’s resources and operational expertise, AAS is positioned to rapidly accelerate growth by expanding contract wins, professionalizing its infrastructure, and enhancing profitability.

Operations: Provides anesthesia staffing (CRNAs & MDAs), billing, and operational support exclusively to ASCs (no hospital exposure).
Ownership: Co-founders Chris Youst (CEO) and Mark Nold (COO) lead the business and will reinvest a significant portion of their equity proceeds. A third shareholder (33% of Michigan entity) will be fully bought out at close.
Headquarters: Troy, Michigan
Competitive Advantages: Strong recruitment/retention despite industry shortages, supported by attractive ambulatory work-life balance. Flexible PRN staffing model enabling quick ramp-up of new contracts. Long-term evergreen contracts providing predictable revenue.

LOI: signed on June 2, 2025, with an anticipated closing by October 31, 2025. 
Process: Run by Greenwich Capital Group, with whom Northern Shore has a long-standing relationship.
Valuation: 7.9x ($34 million). 
Seller Dynamics: Co-Founders remain highly committed post-close, rolling equity alongside Northern Shore and continuing to run the business day-to-day.
Earnout/Multiple buydown: The transaction includes an earnout of 1.0x ($4.5M), which, if paid, would bring total cash consideration to $38.5M. This structure incentivizes growth while also reducing our effective acquisition multiple if the earnout is achieved.

Deep Sector Expertise: Proven track record scaling founder-led healthcare businesses, highlighted by Scott Barry’s leadership at Centria Healthcare. NSC brings to bear repeatable value creation playbooks with demonstrated success in both organic expansion and add-on acquisitions in fragmented healthcare niches.
Founder-Friendly Approach: AAS selected Northern Shore as its preferred partner despite broad buyer interest. There is alignment with management’s growth vision and cultural fit as a Michigan-based partner.
Strategic Resources: Ability to fund accelerated ASC contract growth and professionalize infrastructure (e.g. bringing billing & collections in-house, CFO, recruiting, etc.).

Provider of Choice in Labor-Constrained Market: Serving as a trusted partner to ASCs in an environment of provider shortages, AAS is uniquely positioned to continue capturing market share and will represent a scarce, highly defensible asset at exit.
Proven De Novo Growth: AAS has a demonstrated ability to enter new markets, and when combined with a strategic focus on higher-reimbursement geographies that provide a clear path to margin expansion and enhanced profitability, there is a clear path to $10 million + EBITDA.
Multiple Expansion Potential: While not underwritten to, building a professionalized, scaled anesthesia staffing provider should garner significant buyer interest from both private equity and strategics, creating potential to trade at a significant premium to our purchase multiple and more in-line with that of traditional healthcare services platforms.


================================================================================
SLIDE 6: Our LOI valuation is $34 million cash at close, based on July 2025 TTM EBITDA of $4.3 million. This represents a TEV of $34.0 million plus a contingent earnout of $4.5 million. The NSC equity requirement at this valuation is $15.0 million.
================================================================================
The process is being run by Greenwich Capital Group out of their Birmingham, Michigan office. 
Northern Shore signed an LOI on June 2nd, 2025.
Our LOI values the business at $34.0M (7.9x) cash at close plus a contingent $4.5M earnout based on aggressive future growth targets. If hit, our effective entry multiple would decrease given the growth in EBITDA required to pay the earnouts.
NSC would fund an incremental $5.0 million of cash to the balance sheet to fund SG&A investments and growth of new ASC contracts.
NSC’s investment thesis, sector focus, and experience aligns well with AAS’s ownership and business model.

AAS Michigan was founded in 2009. AAS Indiana was founded in 2022. AAS provides anesthesia staffing (CRNAs & MDAs), billing, and operational support to Ambulatory Surgery Centers (ASCs) in Michigan and Indiana through long-term contracts.
Fee-for-service income is ~20% of overall income (direct payments from ASCs).
Collection-based income & true-up contracts: ~80% (insurance reimbursements + contractual minimums with ASCs).

The business is legally split into two entities for Michigan and Indiana. The Michigan business is owned 33.3% each by co-founders Chris Youst (CEO), Mark Nold (COO), and Mike Bernard (Medical Practice Director). The Indiana business is owned 50/50 by Chris and Mark. 
Chris and Mark and excited to roll equity and continue running the business post-close.
We anticipate financing the transaction with a modest amount of leverage at close (currently assumed to be 3.5x) along with management rollover and equity from Northern Shore.

Employer of choice – ASC-only focus creates ability to recruit and retain talent better than competitors, enabling AAS to capture share;  In a labor-constrained industry, differentiated recruiting and retention position the Company as a scarce and highly-attractive asset.  
Contracted & recurring revenue model with downside protection – multi-year contracts  with built-in labor floors provide predictable, de-risked cash flow and reduce revenue volatility while providing upside opportunity through improved revenue cycle performance.
Strong pipeline of new ASC partnerships in Indiana and Michigan with a model that can easily be replicated in new geographies.
Opportunity to build density in existing markets and expand into new geographies with stronger reimbursement dynamics. 
Led by strong operators with currently limited bandwidth which can be unlocked with Northern Shore’s resources and operational expertise.
Customer Concentration – Significant revenue exposure to IU Health contracts; while evergreen in structure with discrete contracts per ASC, concentration is not without risk. 
Limited Infrastructure & Playbooks – current operations rely heavily on ad hoc processes without standardized systems or formal playbooks; presents both a challenge and a value-creation opportunity through Northern Shore’s implementation of best practices.
Young Management Team – Founders have successfully scaled the business to-date but lack experience operating at larger scale; Northern Shore will provide support with infrastructure, professional management, and oversight to support growth.

================================================================================
SLIDE 7: AAS is winning in a labor-constrained market by solving a pain-point other providers haven’t.
================================================================================
Employer of Choice |  | AAS is the employer of choice in a market facing a severe and worsening shortage of Nurse Anesthetists (“CRNAs”) and Anesthesiologists (“MDAs”) – AAS’s clinician-first model enables recruitment and retention where others struggle. 
AAS is focused exclusively on Ambulatory Surgical Centers (“ASCs”), which enables a superior work-life balance for providers: no nights, weekends, or call shifts. In a specialty plagued by burnout, this matters.
 |  | 
Focused Exclusively on ASCs |  | 
 |  | 
Large, Flexible Staffing Model |  | AAS operates with a large and flexible staffing model allowing efficient scheduling and scaling with the ability to meet new demand quickly – a key advantage as ASC volume continues to rise.
 |  | 
Positioned to Scale |  | Unique model for aggregating a usable labor pool that is well-positioned to scale faster with Northern Shore’s resources and expertise, with the ability to enter new markets at a much more rapid pace than they have historically (e.g., the Indiana expansion in 2022).
 |  | 
Opportunity to Capitalize on Market Shift |  | ASCs and hospitals increasingly view anesthesia as a cost center, AAS is positioned to capitalize with a unique staffing model and pricing structure that lowers costs and complexity for ASCs while preserving strong margins and downside protection.
 |  | 
Platform for Expansion and Improved Profitability |  | AAS is a scalable platform designed to expand into new geographies while also deepening density in current markets, driving improved reimbursement and Revenue Cycle Management (“RCM”) performance.

SLIDE 10: Growth Opportunities
================================================================================
Expand ASC Partnerships – AAS has a strong pipeline of new Ambulatory Surgery Centers (ASCs), particularly in Indiana and Michigan, where management is actively pursuing additional contracts​.
Deeper Penetration into IU Health – AAS currently serves 7 of IU Health’s 17 ASCs. Successfully scaling operations within IU Health could significantly increase revenue​.
Geographic Expansion – The company’s scalable staffing model allows it to expand beyond its current Michigan and Indiana footprint into other states with superior reimbursement rates.
Increased Collections + Labor Floor Contracts – Shifting more ASCs to a billing & collections model with a labor floor provides downside protection with potential for outsized margins to the extent AAS can collect above the floor.

================================================================================
20


================================================================================
SLIDE 21: Base Case Returns ($ in Actuals)
================================================================================
Build Detail and Key Assumptions: 
Revenue forecasted by ASC in accordance with each contract type
3 – 3.5% wage inflation and reimbursement escalators if included in each ASC contract
All 3 Solaris contracts are assumed to expire upon renewal date for conservatism
In addition to Solaris churn, the underwriting case contemplates 1 annual churned contract beginning in mid-year 2026 at an average annual contract value of $1.4M for a total of 8 churned contracts

21


================================================================================
SLIDE 22: New Contract Growth Assumptions
================================================================================
Key Assumptions: 
Base Case New Contract build assumes 16 new Billings & Collections + Labor Floor contracts and 8 new True Up + Management Fee for Indiana  contracts added from 2026 – 2030. Contracts details are based on averages of existing contracts.

Model assumes 2 CRNAs and 1 MDA are staffed consistently from 2026–2030, working 15 days per month, or 180 days annually
Indiana and new geography contracts are all assumed to be True Up + Management Fee as that is standard practice in the state
Billing rates (reimbursements) and Wage Assumptions:
Michigan
Billing Rates: CRNAs at ~$1,603/day, and MDAs at $2,660/day, increasing 3% p.a.
Wages: CRNAs at ~$1,126/day, and MDAs at $2,095/day, increasing 3% p.a.
Indiana and New Geographies
Billing Rates: CRNAs at ~$1,988/day, and MDAs at $3,021/day, increasing 3% p.a.
Wages: CRNAs at ~$1,576/day, and MDAs at $2,249/day, increasing 3% p.a. 
Similar to the build for existing contracts, starting in 2029 new contracts are assumed to churn at a rate of 1 per year using average contract revenue / margin

Model assumes only 8 new contracts (1 – 2 per year) added in each of Michigan and Indiana from 2026-2030
AAS has added an average of 3.5 new contracts per year in Michigan since 2020, and 3.3 per year in Indiana since the expansion in 2023
Assumed expansion to 1 new market in 2027 with 1 – 2 new contracts per year

22


================================================================================
SLIDE 23: Key Assumptions
================================================================================
New CFO expected to start December 1, 2026
Opex is further burdened in 2026 – 2028 by several additional hires outlined above
$868K of additional G&A costs for infrastructure (i.e. EMR), further hires (i.e., Chief Growth Officer), and other infrastructure / hires
The model also assumes CEO and COO salaries rise to $275K and $225K + 50% bonus + 15% burden starting in 2026, from $200K & $150K

23


================================================================================
SLIDE 24: New Contract Growth
================================================================================
Key Assumptions: 
Existing contract build and churn assumptions are all in-line with base case.
NSC Expected Case reflects expansion into 4 new markets, in addition to moderately more aggressive new contract growth assumptions, including:
10 new contracts in both Michigan and Indiana (2 per year)
3 new contracts per year for each new geography
$300K of incremental OpEx over Base Case is assumed to support additional growth

24


================================================================================
SLIDE 25: New Contract Growth
================================================================================
Key Assumptions: 
Existing and new contracts build is in-line with base case, except no new geography expansion is assumed
3 IU contracts are expected to transition to SCA ownership in 2026; all 4 remaining IU Health contracts are assumed to terminate at renewal in addition to all 3 Solaris contracts, and 3 additional average contract churns for total of 13 assumed churned contracts

25


================================================================================
SLIDE 26: Earnout Details
================================================================================
26

Earnout Timeline
Earnout #1: The earnout for meeting Gross Profit targets for 12/31/26 is $2.5 million. Payments will be made in 4 equal quarterly installments of $625,000 commencing on April 1, 2027 
Earnout #2: The earnout for meeting Gross Profit targets for 12/31/27 is $2.0 million. Payments will be made in 4 equal quarterly installments of $500,000 commencing on April 1, 2028
Proposed Gross Profit Targets and Mechanics
Mechanics: Once 85% of the target is achieved, sellers begin earning at a 25% floor of that year’s target earnout, which scales pro-rata to 100% of the target
Earnout #1: $9.5M; reflects minimal growth over sell-side projected Gross Profit of $9.1M which assumes no new contracts over what has already been awarded
Earnout #2: $11.5M; reflects $2M growth (21% YoY) in Gross Profit over 2026 target

Note: per the LOI, if the 2026 earnout is not fully earned but the cumulative Gross Profit for 2026 and 2027 meets or exceeds the combined target thresholds, the full earnout of $4.5 million shall become payable.

================================================================================
SLIDE 28: Key Risks & Mitigants
================================================================================
IV


================================================================================
SLIDE 29: Risks and Mitigants
================================================================================
Risk | Description | Mitigants
Contract Concentration | Majority of Indiana revenues tied to IU Health, with 7 ASCs under contract. | Significant pipeline of new ASC opportunities outside of IU health will significantly reduce concentration under NSC’s ownership period.
All IU Health contracts have 3–5-year evergreen terms with guaranteed labor payments and monthly true-ups.
IU and SCA have a JV across the 7 center portfolio, with SCA looking to acquire 3 of them outright by 2026.
IU Health is a strategic partner that proactively sought out AAS, and management continues to deepen that relationship; additionally, all contracts are separate and tied to each individual ASC.
Scalability & Growth Execution | Growth incumbent upon winning and retaining new contracts, in both existing and new markets. | The Company has successfully demonstrated an ability to land-and-expand in a new market; NSC will pour fuel on fire to expand at an accelerated pace while keeping an eye towards profitability and execution excellence.
Management has demonstrated ability to win RFPs (e.g., IU Health, BNJ) and is actively pursuing pipeline of ASC opportunities.
Strong reputation, long-term partner retention (has never lost a customer involuntarily), and flexible staffing model support scalable growth.
Poor Billing Performance | To the extent AAS under collects and over relies on ASC subsidies, AAS jeopardizes contract health | AAS is in the process of switching to VBRCM from Physicians Choice, which will give significantly more insight into billing performance, allowing for real-time visibility with individual claim-level detail
While still possible, the risk of churn seems lower for contracts where AAS is in compliance of the contract than the risk of contract renegotiation at lower floor / true-up levels
Solaris Churn | The acquisition of Solaris by Cardinal Health may result in anesthesia in-sourcing | We are currently underwriting to all 3 Solaris-owned centers churning upon contract renewal
None of the Solaris-owned contracts are set to renew until 2028 – it is very possible that management turnover or strategy pivots could result in Solaris retaining AAS at some-to-all of the 3 centers, or delaying churn beyond our hold period
Lean Operating Infrastructure | Back office of five remote employees with infrastructure investment required to support sustainable growth. | NSC forecast includes cost for a CFO, market-rate CEO and COO, recruiting and marketing expense, rent, HR personnel and additional back-office support for scheduling, along with general OpEx burden for additional executive and back-office resources. 
Actively working with third-party providers to overhaul internal policies (i.e., compliance handbooks).
Revenue Cycle Management | Low collection performance could lead to ASCs switching anesthesia partners | Conducting a billing and coding audit to assess existing RCM performance and ensure best practices are implemented.
Evaluating both switching RCM providers and the option to bring RCM in-house, with the goal of maximizing collections, strengthening oversight, and maintaining ASC partner satisfaction.
Labor Recruiting & Retention | Recruiting despite the current provider shortage is critical to achieve scale. | AAS has built strong relationships with CRNA programs, regularly recruits at universities, and offers flexible contractor arrangements with attractive compensation.
Historical track record of scaling rapidly to meet demand (e.g., IU ramp-up from 2022-2024)
Ambulatory/outpatient model offers competitive advantage in recruiting (e.g., better work-life balance, etc.).

29


================================================================================
SLIDE 30: Risks and Mitigants
================================================================================
Risk | Description | Mitigants
Reimbursement Risk | Changes in reimbursement or ASC regulations could negatively impact collections. | Indiana revenue is insulated from reimbursement risk via floor-plus-true-up contracts.
In Michigan, over 50% of revenue is fee-for-day (not tied to collections).
Commercial payors represent over 80% of revenue subject to reimbursement risk, heavily weighted towards BCBS.
Underwriting model only projects hitting the labor floor – no assumed upside from improved RCM.
Key Person Risk | Chris Youst and Mark Nold are critical to the Company’s success. | Chris and Mark will retain meaningful equity post-close through their collective $8M rollover investment. 
We have entered into employment contracts with both Chris and Mark – both executives have a 2-year non-compete clause in their contracts
Contractor Model & General Compliance | Use of 1099 contractors can create regulatory or reclassification risks. | The Company has converted all full-time and regular part-time staff to W2 employees prior to closing, at no incremental cost to the business
AAS has engaged Health Law Partners to create a formal compliance program for the Company
Lawsuits from Provider Negligence | AAS was named in a recent lawsuit due to a 1099 provider’s mis-administration of anesthesia | We have received a specific indemnity for the recent lawsuit and the Company is likely not to be named in future proceedings regardless
Historically, the risk has been nearly negligible as AAS has had one only one claim since their policy began in 2010  - a $45K payout in January 2019

Sources: Signify Research, Rivanna Medical; IBIS World

The U.S. Anesthesia Services market was valued at $27.4 billion as of 2024, and is expected to grow at a 7.9% CAGR through 2031. 
The market is poised for steady growth, underpinned by demographic trends, technological innovation, and the general shift to outpatient care. 
While the market faces challenges such as workforce shortages and cost pressures, advancements in drugs, devices, and digital technologies are expected to drive improvements in safety, efficiency, and patient outcomes. 
Hospitals remain the dominant end-users, but ASCs are rapidly gaining market share due to the shift towards outpatient care.

In September 2024, Eugia Steriles, a subsidiary of Aurobindo Pharma, received approval for Lidocaine Hydrochloride injection, used as an anesthetic on the body to help reduce discomfort and pain caused by invasive procedures.
In August 2024, Amneal Pharmaceutivals announced FDA approval for its Propofol Injectable Emulsion in three single-dose vial concentrations and it is widely used in hospitals for inducing and maintaining anesthesia and sedation.
In February 2024, Hikma Pharmaceuticals launched Fentanyl Citrate Injection. This medication is designed for short-duration analgesia during anesthesia, premedication, induction, maintenance, and immediate postoperative recovery.

SLIDE 34: U.S. ASC Market Size Outlook
================================================================================
The U.S. Anesthesia Staffing market is experiencing a critical and worsening shortage of both anesthesiologists and Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetists (“CRNAs”), with up to 78% of facilities reporting shortages as of the end of 2022, up from approximately 35% pre-pandemic.
Projections indicate a shortfall of approximately 6,300 anesthesiologists by 2036, and a 22% workforce shortage across anesthesiology by 2033. 
The primary drivers of these shortages include:
An ageing anesthesia workforce (over half of anesthesiologists are over 55) compounded by increasing retirement rates, particularly accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Limited pipeline of new providers due to restricted residency positions.
Rising demand for surgical and procedural anesthesia, especially as the population ages and seeks more procedures.

Sources: Medicus Healthcare Research; American Society of Anesthesiologists; Outpatient Surgery Magazine

The shift towards outpatient and minimally invasive procedures is accelerating demand for anesthesia in ambulatory settings.
Ambulatory Surgical Centers (“ASCs”) are particularly affected by anesthesia staffing shortages, leading to operational challenges and margin compression due to rising labor costs and stagnant payer reimbursement. 
ASCs increasingly rely on a mix of employed anesthesiologists, CRNAs, and 1099 providers to maintain coverage. 
As the anesthesia staffing shortage persists and worsens, ASCs and other ambulatory providers will need to continue innovating with staffing models, compensation, and operational efficiencies to maintain adequate anesthesia coverage and financial viability.
Strategic partnerships with staffing agencies, adoption of care team models, and proactive workforce planning will be essential for success in the evolving market.

The anesthesia staffing market, especially for ambulatory anesthesia, is marked by acute shortages, rising demand, and a need for flexible, innovative staffing solutions to ensure continuity and quality of care.

5.7% CAGR

($ in billions)

In recent years, states have been passing legislation to eliminate the need for direct physician supervision over CRNAs for many procedures, opening a path for greater CRNA growth.
Due to rapid demand of healthcare services and spending, employment of Anesthesiologists and CRNAs is projected to grow faster than the average occupation through 2032.

SLIDE 35: Anesthesia in the ASC Value-Chain
================================================================================
Sources: Becker’s ASC Review; National Library of Medicine.

Anesthesia is a high-value, low-cost component of the ASC value-chain that underpins safety, efficiency, and patient satisfaction in ASC surgical operations.
For common procedures in ambulatory / outpatient settings, anesthesia represents as little as <1% to as much as 20% of the total cost of the procedure, depending on the complexity and type of procedure. 
For example, for a typical lens/cataract surgery, anesthesia represents ~0.7% of the cost, while in something like Carpal Tunnel Release (CTR) surgery, it can represent ~20% of total cost. 
The top three procedure types in AAS’s current business mix are (i) Ophthalmologic, (ii) Orthopedic, and (iii) neuromuscular procedures, which represent 23, 18, and 13% of total collections in 2024, respectively. 
In ASC settings, these procedures represent a relatively modest portion (4-15%) of total cost, as outlined in the table below:

Procedure Type | Example Procedure | Anesthesia % of Total Cost (ASC)
Ophthalmologic | Cataract, Vitrectomy (PPV) | 4-10%
Orthopedic | Knee / Shoulder Arthroscopy | 7-15%
Neuromuscular | Carpal Tunnel, Spinal Stim | 2-15%

================================================================================
SLIDE 42: DAG, PLLC
================================================================================
Our legal due diligence uncovered that, unintentionally, the Company has been operating in Michigan incorrectly as an LLC, whereas medical practices need to be registered as a PLLC (or PC). The Company’s LLC structure in Indiana is compliant. 
As a result, the Company is undergoing a pre-closing restructuring as outlined below to rectify the issue. 
The Company has been operating in good faith, with proper licensure and credentials, with the primary purposes of providing anesthesia staffing solutions. As a result, we do not believe there is any regulatory risk and, at any rate, we will be indemnified by the Sellers for any pre-closing liabilities related to this issue. Going forward, we will have an orthodox Corporate Practice of Medicine (“CPOM”) structure in place in full compliance with all regulatory statutes.

As part of its pre-closing restructuring, the Company is working with Varnum on:
Certificate of Conversion and PLLC Articles of Organization
Certificate of Correct and PLLC Articles of Organization
Restating Articles of Organization for PLLC
Implications of PLLC Conversion
The tax treatment will remain the same for each entity – preventing any changes in FEIN
Conversion does not trigger any change of control provisions with existing contracts.
Counsel does not anticipate any penalties related to a conversion.

================================================================================
SLIDE 43: Buyer
================================================================================
The post-closing legal structure will reflect a CPOM-compliant organization. The new management Company will enter into an Asset Purchase Agreement (“APA”) with the practice entity to purchase the non-clinical assets of the PE. 
The Management Company and Practice Entity will enter into an Administrative Services Agreement (“ASA”) and Deficit Loan Funding Agreement (“DFLA”); while all entities will enter into a Securities Transfer Restriction Agreement (“STRA”). 
This structure allows the management company to effectively exercise full operational control of all non-clinical aspects of the business.

Diligence Topic | Description | Status / Resolution | Impact on Investment Thesis | Status
Balance Billing | Collections across the business are at ~95% and AAS is consistently hitting the labor floor in most contracts | All of the collections by ASC are within compliance of the contract specifications; the primary cause of lower-than-expected collections is a result of patient balances. Additionally, management is switching to a new RCM provider (VBRCM) starting in 2026 | Given none of the contracts are explicitly at risk, the opportunity to improve on collections, specifically patient balances, represents upside to our underwriting | Partial
IU Relationship | Collections below 97% of allowables trigger requirement for monthly reports and corrective action plans. Risk of true-up / management fee renegotiation or relationship loss | Confirmed that collections are >98% when removing outstanding patient balances, per contract. | Uncertain, but pending feedback from management and IU Health customer call could be net positive; risk of churn captured in Downside Case | Closed
General Compliance Checklist | Does AAS maintain a formal compliance program (manual, credentialing, verification)? | Engaging third-party (Health Law Partners) to begin creating compliance handbook, targeting completion by close date | Indemnification covers exposure through closing; new compliance program will be in place at-close ensuring no risk borne by NSC | Closed
IU Hand to Shoulder (IUHTS) | The surgeon group running IUHTS left for competing OrthoIndy for better economics, resulting in no staffing from April – May, and 0.3 FTE levels from June - October | IU has backfilled hand and shoulder surgery procedures by diverting ENT procedure flow through to the center; starting 10/27, staffing is expected to rise to full time operations with 1.4 FTE staffed, ramping back to 2.4 FTE by Q1 2026 | Net MOIC impact is minimal at (0.1x), assuming return to normalized staffing in March 2026 | Closed
Ball Outpatient Surgery Center (BOSC) Lawsuit | In the disclosure schedules, a complaint was filed on 10/10/2025 naming BOSC Gina Diaz and AAS Indiana, along with two other staffing providers | AAS is not involved in clinical decision-making during patient care and is indemnified under the 1099 contractor agreement; | None – AAS is not expected to be named in further proceedings, and NSC has received a specific indemnity for the claim | Closed

Diligence Topic | Description | Status / Resolution | Impact on Investment Thesis | Status
MIP Plan | Current allocation of the MIP may be too high, limiting capacity to reserve equity for future critical hires (e.g., CFO, senior leadership) | After back and forth, management has landed on allocation of only 16% of the MIP, leaving significant room for future hires | With 16% allocated today, we have room to provide more equity to attract certain key hires, i.e., CFO | Closed
Solaris Health Acquisition | Cardinal Health acquired Solaris; potential concern whether acquisition drives contract changes | Contracts remain independent; aggregator ownership does not typically trigger wholesale vendor changes especially in new markets | Model assumes Solaris contracts churn at renewal. Extension would be upside, adding 0.5x MOIC | Closed
Hospital-Owned ASC Viability | Hospital-Owned ASCs (e.g., IU Health) may not be ideal long-term partners given risk of insourcing anesthesia | Providers typically prefer either ASC or hospital settings, limiting cross-coverage potential.  ASC scheduling needs vary widely and require a deep bench of providers, making insourcing cost-prohibitive for hospitals | Supports thesis that staffing remains outsourced across ownership models. Underwriting does not rely on hospital system wins given prevalence of indep. and mgmt co.-owned ASCs | Closed
1099 to W2 Conversion | ~40 AAS employees were non-compliantly classified as 1099 and must be converted to W2 pre-closing | Conversion is complete, with all prior full-time 1099 providers converted to W2 | Net impact is a $54K benefit to the Company as of latest modeling | Closed
Anesthesia Staffing Market Perception | Risk that ASCs view anesthesia groups as temporary staffing stop gaps | Research (Chartis, management meetings, expert calls) suggest this is not the case – groups are viewed as strategic partners where exclusivity is contractual | Supports durability of ASC relationships and validates thesis | Closed

New ASC Delay | American Pain Consortium (5.2 FTE across 4 centers) and Westfield Surgery Center (5 FTE) have been delayed to November and December starts from October and August, respectively | Westfield has been delayed due to flooding damage during renovations and is purely a timing delay; APC is waiting for the head of operations to return from maternity leave and provide a start date | Both delays impact 2025 performance but should not have any impact on 2026 revenue or Gross Profit | Closed

SLIDE 50: Market Drivers
================================================================================
The U.S. Anesthesia market is forecasted to reach a shortage of ~6,300 anesthesiologists by 2036, primarily driven by:
Surgical Demand: surgical services are expected to continue growing at 2-3% p.a. over the next decade
Provider Burnout: nearly half of anesthesiologists report burnout, with 61% open to reducing pay for improved work-life balance
Top-of-Funnel Limitations: In 2024, only 1,695 positions were available for anesthesia residency
Aging Workforce: 38% of anesthesiologists are 55 or older, and the cohort of 65+ providers is projected to grow 30% by 2035

There is a shortage of ~3,000 anesthesiologists nationwide, with Texas, Florida, North Carolina, and Georgia exhibiting the largest supply shortage
Physician staffing demand relative to need is appropriately aligned in Indiana and Michigan, with Ohio and Illinois showing a slight oversupply 
Within Midwest states, Minnesota has growing physician supply shortages relative to need
The Southeast region has growing demand needs. Aligned with a potential AAS playbook to enter new markets, the Southeast may be suitable given growing imbalance

SLIDE 51: Key Commentary
================================================================================
AAS already has a foothold in Indianapolis and Fort Wayne – adding density would enhance staffing efficiency
USPI is a dominant player making system-wide partnership a potential if AAS can land and expand, however the market remains fragmented with 124 ASCs without a management company

USPI Represents an Attractive Partnership Opportunity for AAS

Significant Runway Exists to Increase Density in AAS Existing Markets

SLIDE 52: Anesthesia Consolidator Market Share by State
================================================================================

Sources: Chartis Market Study

Leveraging Chartis data, California and Oregon represent the most attractive expansion states, based on equal weighting of commercial reimbursement rates, market entrance difficulty, and a minimum of 50 ASCs per state


================================================================================
SLIDE 53: Key Considerations
================================================================================
53

Sources: Chartis Market Study

The scope of the new geography scorecard was limited to only 2 variables – reimbursement rates and market saturation of existing consolidators. Relevant follow-on considerations include:
Minimum ASCs: The previous analysis screened for states with at least 50 ASCs, however distribution within a state likely is more important than raw count as distribution may be uneven across individual markets. Expansion is most viable where there is a meaningful cluster within driving distance for provider scheduling efficiency
Regulatory Dynamics: Licensing requirements, CRNA supervision requirements, and anesthesia scope of practice rules all vary by state. States that restrict Independent CRNA practice, for example, generally drive higher staffing costs and reduce flexibility
Payor Concentration: States where 1-3 payors dominate commercial market share introduces leverage against anesthesia providers, limiting reimbursement upside and increasing contract concentration risk
Anesthesia Supply / Demand: Provider shortages may present unique opportunities for entry, but may also introduce escalated staffing costs and potential coverage unreliability. States with deeper anesthesia pools may be more structurally favorable
Certificate of Need (“CON”) Laws for ASC development: CON requirements restrict new ASC development, making growth reliant on acquiring existing centers and stealing share. Non-CON states support more robust de novo growth opportunities

Former Tenet Healthcare Competitor Thinks Ambulatory Surgery Centers Tend to Outsource – 08/19/2024
Q: “What about the ambulatory surgery centers? Are they more likely to outsource or to have their people in-house, especially given the fact that they tend to have very consistent hours?”
A: “I hate to use that term, but they're the kings of outsourcing. The outsourcing started with the ambulatory surgery centers. Because they function in a manner that may be very limited, so they bring in people when they need them. That makes sense to them.”
Former CIO of U.S. Anesthesia Partners Thinks the Industry’s Facing a Coming Shortage of Anesthesiologists – 05/11/2023 
Q: “Why is anesthesiology different? For instance, if you're a hospital, you have the capability to hire doctors, nurses, orderlies, technicians, radiologists, janitors, receptionists. Hospitals hire a wide variety of people with a wide variety of skills and they do that themselves. Why is anesthesiology different? Why do the hospitals have difficulty doing this themselves and why are they going to an outside agency instead of staffing up themselves?”
A: “Yeah. Staffing up themselves is one option, but I think the hospitals that have tried that have gotten themselves into trouble in a couple of areas. One, it's just having the right number of staff and people that are available to cover the different OR rooms. For a health system, the OR is the most profitable area, that's where they make the most money, and having staff anesthesiologists to cover those, because obviously you can't perform in OR if you don't have them, and what I've come to realize is, over my last couple of years, how important the anesthesiologist is to the surgery…”
“Basically, if you staff your hospital for max capacity OR, you got a lot of anesthesiologists sitting around doing nothing. If you staff for minimum, you have everyone else who can't do their job. Basically, the issue isn't that the hospitals can't do it. It's that demand fluctuates so wildly that it's difficult to have that particular group of people on staff full-time.”

SLIDE 61: AAS Hiring & HR Process
================================================================================
Amy Elliott conducted a detailed review of AAS’s broader hiring and HR processes, identifying current practices, system gaps, and opportunities for improvement.

Clinician Hiring & Onboarding: Leads sourced via referral, social media, and job postings  initial screening by leadership, followed by contract issuance  credentialing handled via Connecteam  ASC clearance requires 1–3 months  payroll setup completed post-credentialing.
Compliance & Credential Tracking: Connecteam used for document storage and tracking, however no background checks are performed currently, only license verification.
Staffing & PRN Utilization: 
PRN staff flexes up/down to meet ASC demand; flexing down is favored for retention
Connecteam provides real-time visibility of cleared PRN availability for each ASC
Termination Process: 
AAS has no involuntary terminations; voluntary staff are shifted to other ASCs
Employees are either made PRN or inactive if no longer interested in working. There are look-backs for staff that have not worked in the last 6 months, but this is inconsistently performed
Marketing & Social Media: AAS utilizes “Basso” to manage their website, 4 social media posts per week, key searches and analytics.
System Limitations: 
Connecteam does not differentiate 1099 vs W2 and would require additional cost to acquire those features
Connecteam does not have an Applicant Tracking System (“ATS”) to support candidate pipeline management
Connecteam costs are incurred per active user
Recommendations:
Review Basso contract for potential savings and expanded digital outreach (email campaigns, candidate sourcing)
Implement an ATS to build candidate pipelines and track hires
Enhance Connecteam functionality (status tracking, user categorization)
Invest in back-office team, role clarity, and specialization
Add HR/recruiter roles to support scaling
Ensure full compliance on background checks and credentialing under W2 models

SLIDE 65: Prevalence of W2 Versus 1099 Job Postings
================================================================================
As of September 24, 2025, exact counts of active job postings specifying W2 (employee with benefits) vs 1099 (independent contractor/locums) remain challenging to pinpoint, as many listings imply but do not explicitly state the classification, however we have summarized key insights based on the postings that were found.

Key Insights
City Comparison: Detroit has a higher W2:1099 ratio (~1.9:1 average) than Indianapolis (~1.5:1), reflecting Detroit's emphasis on employed models in high-volume hospitals amid trauma demand. Indianapolis postings are more balanced, with 1099 growth (~15–20% YoY) for locums in OB/ortho at surgery centers.
Role Comparison: CRNAs show a stronger W2 skew (1.75:1 average) than Anesthesiologists (1.65:1), as CRNAs often integrate into ACT teams with benefits. Anesthesiologists have more 1099 for short-term subspecialty needs (e.g., no-call locums). 
Key Trends: 1099 postings are up ~20% YoY nationally per AANA, driven by flexibility, but W2 dominates (55–70%) for benefits like malpractice and PTO. Unspecified listings (~35%) likely W2 in large systems. Premiums for 1099: $20–$50/hr. more, but self-managed taxes/insurance.
Limitations: Estimates from ~20–50 listings per category; duplicates reduce the unique by 20%. For precision, we filtered Indeed ("W2" or "1099").

Amy Elliott has led the CFO search process on behalf of AAS, utilizing both public job postings on LinkedIn, as well as proactive outreach to qualified candidates across the PE-backed physician practice management landscape. The job posting results have naturally been much quicker to yield results, however the quality of applicants has been far below the direct sourcing  method.
